<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
  It is played on a checkerboard with ordinary checkers pieces.
  The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly
  capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all
  of the pieces into one group of pieces of black or white that are
  connected. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally,
  vertically, or diagonally.

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>
  Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first.
  Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally,
  vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square
  occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board.
  A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them),
  but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures.
  A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the
  total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it
  chooses to move (the line of action). This line contains both the
  squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the
  square the piece is on. A piece may not move off the board, onto
  another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>

<p>
  We will play Lines of Action by moving each pieces diagonally,
  vertically, or horizontally according to the total counts in that
  direction.
  To move a piece, please click on the piece and the desired square.
  The original set of this game is manual black, which mean you as a
  player plays the black side, and the white side is played by an AI.
  If you wish to change the settings, go to Settings and choose the
  setting according to you preference.
  There are 4 settings:
  1. Manual Black : The original settings of this game.
  2. Manual White : The white piece become manual.
  3. Auto Black : The black piece become auto. If the white is also auto,
                  then we have a AI vs. AI match!
  4. Auto White : The original settings of this game.

  You can also change the seed for the AI and set the move limit.
  To change the seed, go to Settings > Seed > Enter the desired seed.
  To change the move limit, go to Settings > Limit > Enter the desired
  limit per player.
