# Ellsa Fiorenza's Portfolio
I am a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science with minor in Computer Science. Currently, I am doing internship with two companies as a Research and Analyst Intern at Stickearn - a digital advertising company based in Jakarta, Indonesia - and as a Software Engineer Intern at JP Morgan Chase & Co. US. To learn more about my background and qualifications, you can contact me at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellsa-fiorenza/">LinkedIn.</a>

## Data Science Projects
### Basketball Analysis (Modelling)
This project focuses to analyze NBA team performance from the player's statistics and to find out which college produces the best NBA players. In this project we perform the ETL process using pandas to fill in the missing values. To predict the a good player, we build linear regression and random forest models.

### Contraceptive Usage in Indonesia (A/B Testing)
The goal of this project is to see the correlation between religion and contraceptive usage amongs Indonesian women affects the total children they have.  To analyze this relationship, we use A/B testing by mean different of the total number of children where we compare the mean number of children from mother who are Muslim and not. We also create a linear regression to see the correlation of mother's age and the total children in the household. From our analysis, we found  out that Muslim mothers, on average, have more children compared to non Muslim mothers. From the linear regression, as the mother age increases, the number of children increases as well.

## Game Projects
### Lines of Actions (Java)
Lines of Actions is a board game where each dot (black or white) can move diagonally and straight in upward or downward directions only as far as the total number of dots in that line. This projects is using Java and has 2 options to play it: play with a friend or beat the AI. The AI is implemented using alpha-beta pruning to achieve the shortest winning path. User can try playing the game since the interactive GUI is implemented.

### Ants (Python)
Ants works very similar as Plant vs. Zombie where the ants fight againts various type of bees. This game is very fun since we can implement various type of ants fighting againts bees.

## Data Structure Projects
### Enigma
Building a replica of enigma machine that can decode a series of code.

## Artificial Intelligence Projects
### Crowd Analysis
To estimate the total people who see an advertisement or to know the estimation number of people inside a store, I implemented a crowd analytics analysis using Yolo (object detection and tracking). I collected the data using a store cctv camera, break them into 2 frames/seconds and do data labelling using <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">labelImg</a>. From this data, we split them into train (70%) and test (30%) data, then train it using Yolo. The results gives us an estimation of the number of people inside the store.

### Search
Using BFS, DFS, A*, heuristic search, this program will look for the best path to collect food efficiently. The code is implemented using pacman games!

### Multiagent
Using minimax and alpha-beta pruning, this program will return the best action that resulting in the maximum score. The code is implemented using pacman games!

### Ghostbuster
Applying sensor for the pacman to detect food and invisible ghost. Therefore, the pacman will eat food and invisible ghost nearby.

### Reinforcement Learning
Using Value-Iteration, Q-Learning, and epsilon greedy, this program find the best path from learning each state's reward. The code is implemented using pacman games!
